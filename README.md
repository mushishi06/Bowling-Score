# Bowling-Score

### Rule:

Ten-pin bowling scoring rules: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring 

### Goal:

Create a Python class that will keep accurate score in a ten-pin bowling match
for a single player, with unit tests in place to prove the accuracy of your scoring
mechanism.

Feel free to use any 3rd party libraries if theyâ€™re beneficial to the overall
solution.
